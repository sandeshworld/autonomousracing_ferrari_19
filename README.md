Description:
Using the ROS framework, our group programmed the 1/10th scale F1 car to use LIDAR data to navigate around 
a racetrack autonomously. The repo contains the final code for the race. In the class, we explored hector_SLAM (map generation tool), machine learning algorithms to detect optimal gap following route, and various other autonomous driving control techniques.

Final Outcome:
Won the fastest lap award in the final autonomous driving competition by a large margin.
